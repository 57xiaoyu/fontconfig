	+ Reimplement FC_LANG as new datatype.  Lists of strings
	  was consuming over a megabyte of memory for 401 fonts.

	+ Freeze patterns loaded from cache files.  This shares
	  common value lists and common patterns which saves
	  considerable memory.

	+ Change the denotation of 'constant' charsets to use special
	  ref value instead of separate boolean.

	+ Clean up leak tracing stuff, found several unannoted alloc/free
	  calls

	+ Fix autoconf files to pass FONTCONFIG_PATH on
	  compile line so that ${prefix} gets substituted
	  correctly.

	+ Use getc_unlocked/putc_unlocked on systems that
	  provide them to avoid damage done to stdio by posix

	+ Eliminate FC_PATTERN and FcTypePattern in favor of
	  an extended api for FcConfigSubstitute which takes
	  both the font and the pattern.

	+ Add 'sans serif' alias for 'sans-serif' as some apps
	  can't handle hyphens in family names

	+ Eliminate pretense of support for libxml2

	+ Comment origins of Han orthographies

	+ Add binding property to edit element so that strong
	  binding values may be inserted by the config file.
	  The default remains weak.

	+ Tagged release candidate 1 in the CVS tree and
	  placed fcpackage.rc1.tar.gz for distribution

	+ Fixed autoconf builds to always specify install
	  target files (for BSD).  Also fixed to
	  define FONTCONFIG_PATH in config.h so that
	  nonstandard installs will actually work.
