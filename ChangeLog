	+ Fix autoconf files to pass FONTCONFIG_PATH on
	  compile line so that ${prefix} gets substituted
	  correctly.

	+ Use getc_unlocked/putc_unlocked on systems that
	  provide them to avoid damage done to stdio by posix

	+ Eliminate FC_PATTERN and FcTypePattern in favor of
	  an extended api for FcConfigSubstitute which takes
	  both the font and the pattern.

	+ Add 'sans serif' alias for 'sans-serif' as some apps
	  can't handle hyphens in family names

	+ Eliminate pretense of support for libxml2

	+ Comment origins of Han orthographies

	+ Add binding property to edit element so that strong

	+ Fixed autoconf builds to always specify install
	  target files (for BSD).  Also fixed to
	  define FONTCONFIG_PATH in config.h so that
	  nonstandard installs will actually work.
