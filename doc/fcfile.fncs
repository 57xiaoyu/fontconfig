@PURPOSE@	scan a font file
@DESC@
Scans a single file and adds all fonts found to <parameter>set</parameter>.
If <parameter>force</parameter> is FcTrue, then the file is scanned even if
associated information is found in <parameter>cache</parameter>.  If
<parameter>file</parameter> is a directory, it is added to
<parameter>dirs</parameter>. Whether fonts are found depends on fontconfig
policy as well as the current configuration. Internally, fontconfig will
ignore BDF and PCF fonts which are not in Unicode (or the effectively
equivalent ISO Latin-1) encoding as those are not usable by Unicode-based
applications. The configuration can ignore fonts based on filename or
contents of the font file itself.

@PURPOSE@	scan a font directory
@DESC@
Scans an entire directory and adds all fonts found to
<parameter>set</parameter>.  If <parameter>force</parameter> is FcTrue, then
the directory and all files within it are scanned even if information is
present in the per-directory cache file or <parameter>cache</parameter>.  Any
subdirectories found are added to <parameter>dirs</parameter>. See the
manual for <function>FcFileScan</function> for a description of how
fontconfig selects which fonts to include.
