A null or empty 'name' indicates that the default configuration file should

FC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.  Next, if the name starts with '~', it

doesn't start with '/', it refers to a file in the default configuration
directory; the built-in default directory can be overridden with the
FC_CONFIG_DIR environment variable.
