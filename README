		        2004-5-29

2.2.95

Add FcResultOutOfMemory so FcFontSetMatch can return accurate error.

Replace MIN/MAX/ABS macros which happened to be in old FreeType releases
with FC_MIN/FC_MAX/FC_ABS macros owned by fontconfig.

2.2.94

The 2.2.93 release was prepared with a broken libtool which created
the shared library without the '.so' in the file names.

2.2.93

This is the third prerelease of fontconfig 2.3.  Significant changes from
2.2.92 are:

 o	Use new FreeType #include syntax
 o	use y_ppem field instead of 'height' in bitmap sizes rec -
 	FreeType changed the semantics.  Still uses height for
	older versions of FreeType
 o	Don't construct program manuals unless docbook is available

2.2.92

 o	make distcheck work

2.2.91

 o	Switch to SGML manuals
 o	Add FC_DUAL width spacing value
 o	Add FcFini to close out fontconfig and release all memory
 
2.2

This is the third public release of fontconfig, a font configuration and
customization library.  Fontconfig is designed to locate fonts within the
system and select them according to requirements specified by applications.

Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a particular
rasterization library on the application.  The X-specific library
'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and rasterize fonts.
