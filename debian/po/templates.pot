#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"The FreeType font library can adjust glyph outlines to accomodate the pixel "
"grid for improved legibility.  This process is called \"hinting\".  FreeType "
"can either use the hints built-in to each font or it can use a format-"
"indepedent Autohinter.  For most font formats, using the format-specific "
"hints generates better results.  However, many freely available TrueType "
"format fonts don't include any hints at all. When loading such a font, "
"unless you specifically ask to use the Autohinter, these fonts will end up "
"unhinted, which will make them appear fuzzy on the screen."

"With known sub-pixel geometry, LCD screens can synthesize higher resolution "

"which it can generally do when the monitor is built into the computer or "
